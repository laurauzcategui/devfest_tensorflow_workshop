credits to: [Laurence Moroney](https://twitter.com/lmoroney), borrowed images and functions from his Tensorflow in Practice course.

On this workshop you will learn a bit more about Machine Learning in general and you will build a model that will help you grasp the following: 

The workshop is divided in 2 sections, one for tackling the basics and to get you started in tensorflow and keras and the second part where we will be building a Convolutional Neural Net to build an image classifier

**[Part I](./beginner/)**
1. Basics of Tensorflow and Keras
2. How to build a model 
3. What are Optimizer and Loss functions and why you need them?
4. You will train a Model and get predictions 

**[Part II](./intermediate)**

5. Preprocessing your data
    1. Obtain your data
    2. Load your data using image generator 
    3. Explore your data
6. Image classification and Neural Networks
    1. Build a model 
    2. Configure 
    3. Train your model
    4. Test it :)

**Bonus points:** If we have time, we will go through an explanation of Data Augmentation

**Note**: The following notebooks have functionality that only works in Google Colab. If you would like to make it work locally you might need to remove this functions.
